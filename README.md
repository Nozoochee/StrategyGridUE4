# Strategy Game Grid
A grid system often found in strategy/tactics games built 100% in blueprints for UE4.26 (should be compatible with more recent versions too).

## Features:
- Square grid that bases it's generation around the navmesh, allowing for it to take collisions into account
- Placing units and obstacles at runtime
- Capturing neutral/enemy tiles
- Simple AI that plays to the same rules
